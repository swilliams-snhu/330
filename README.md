This project has helped me exercise skills of understanding a whole group of many different things as individual things. I would break up the tasks into smaller piece and lay them out in what needed to be tackled first based on priority and necessity. This is how I design work at my current job.

I would develop code modularly and feed straight into iterative development. After I thought one piece was complete, I would test it and verify if it was correct. This ensured that I knew pieces were working before moving on to something new, and it allowed me stay on track. This is how I approach the work at my job, as well.

I had never developed graphics via code before this class. I don't think that I will be able to pull any graphics specifics from this course, but I got practice with VS and cpp. This course also gave me more knowledge on a different type of development and made me more well rounded as a developer.
